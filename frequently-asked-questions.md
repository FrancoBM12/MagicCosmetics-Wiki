## Why do all the cosmetics appear as unavailable?

It's very simple... you don't have added the permission path in your cosmetics. go to `MagicCosmetics/cosmetics/` and find your cosmetics file now proceed to add the permission path.\
Then save it and go to the game, and finally reload the files with `/cosmetics reload`.

## How do I add permission to a cosmetic?

It is that simple, you can rename the permission to your liking and if the path is not there, you add it.

## I just used the add-on for Oraxen with the latest version of Oraxen but my menu looks like this...

The problem occurs in that Oraxen in recent versions has the ability to format all inventory titles and that deforms the cosmetic inventory.\
\- Go to your Oraxen plugin folder and open the settings.yml file\
and deactivate the option inside `Plugin.formatting.inventory_titles` after this you will have to restart the server.\
\- If your server is lower than 1.19.3 disable this option `Plugin.experimental.convert_pack_for_1_19_3`.
