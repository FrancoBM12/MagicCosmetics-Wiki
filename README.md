You can enjoy this plugin in this range of very entertaining versions!

## Why MagicCosmetics?

MagicCosmetics is a cosmetics plugin designed to give the server one of the best experiences in terms of player and cosmetics.\
we have a total quantity of 5 different [types of cosmetics](type-of-cosmetics.md)\
It is fully configurable, and we do not like that players can not use all the features of the plugin, because that would limit them and that is not our intention!\
It has a unique wardrobe, menu & token system.\
It has a free color menu where you can dye any type of item (dyeable) according to the condition you set!\
you can unlock cosmetics by permissions or by tokens\
has MySQL support\
Everything works client-side so it should not affect the server at all.\
Among many other things.\
